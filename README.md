# ETL Challenge
## Chipotle store locations and Census population data
This project uses one dataset from Kaggle about Chipotle store locations and is merged with a second dataset about population data from the 2010 US Census. The original data are formatted as .csv so they will need to be read into Jupytyer Lab, formatted as dataframes, and then cleaned and merged using Pandas. Finally, because the merged data is relational, it will be imported into pgAdmin and made available for analysis via SQL.
